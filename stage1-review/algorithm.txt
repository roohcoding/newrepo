Stage1- review Algorithm
(

Step 1:- Open Git Terminal > create folder mkdir stage1-review > create files x.java , y.py , z.js by using touch command > create day4.sh and algorithm.txt using touch command.
         Output: 1) stage1-review created.
                 2) Files x.java, y.py, z.js created.
                 3) day4.sh and algorithm.txt created.


Step 2:- Create folders X, Y, Z using mkdir command in folder stage1-review.
         Output: stage1review > X > Y > Z

Step 3:- create nested folder java, py, js in repective folder X, Y, Z by using mkdir -p
         Output: nested folder created
                 X/java
                 Y/py
                 Z/js
Step 4:- Now we have to move files x.java, y.py, z.js in te folder X/java, Y/py, Z/js by using for loop in nano editor
         command nano day4.sh 
         Output: X/java/x.java
                 Y/py/y.py
                 Z/js/z.js
        for loop syntax (for ls file name
                         do 
                           mv file/folder
                         done )
